# UVIC-API

Started with VikeLabs' [StudySpaceFinder](https://github.com/VikeLabs/StudySpaceFinder), this project
provides an API for University of Victoria data, allowing future projects to access and utilize this
information. The currently used tech stack:

- Golang (v1.20)
  - [Chi](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-chi/chi@v1.5.4): a small and simple router.
  - [GORM](https://gorm.io/): Object Relational Mapper for Golang.
- SQLite: for Study Space Finder data.
- Docker.

## Get started

## Contributing

This project is open source and contributions are welcome. If you encounter a bug or have
a feature request, please open an issue on the GitHub repository, and if you are interested
in becoming a maintainer, pm Scott (_@Closepanda#7203)_) or Hal (_haln#0584_) on Discord!

NOTE: In the interest of learning and sharing knowledge, the current tech stack is beginner-friendly,
frankly the Go language is beginner-friendly (have you used Rust before, _dammit_?!). You'd do well with
general knowledge of HTTP/HTTPS, JSON, SQL, and some basic knowledge of programming, really.
